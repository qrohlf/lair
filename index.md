# Lair is your own personal PaaS

Lair installs with a single command on your development machine or your server through the magic of Vagrant and Puppet. 

It's powered by [Dokku](https://github.com/progrium/dokku), so deploying applications becomes as simple as `git push`. It even includes a realtime activity monitor, so you can see what's going on under the hood from the comfort of your browser.

Basically, Lair is the fastest way to get a Heroku-like development environment up and running.
